ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! My name is **Matt (he/him)**, and I am a second year ***Computer Science major*** and ***Math minor*** at **Northeastern University**. I am currently living in Boston, MA and am looking for a full-time software engineering co-op from July-December 2022.

Much of my programming experience is in Java, however I also have experience in C, Python, and HTML/CSS, and I am learning JavaScript and Swift through projects I am currently working on.
