👋 Hi there! My name is **Matt (he/him)**, and I am a second year ***Computer Science major*** and ***Math minor*** at **Northeastern University**. I am currently living in Boston, MA and am looking for a full-time software engineering co-op from July-December 2022.

Much of my programming experience is in Java, however I also have experience in C, Python, and HTML/CSS, and I am learning JavaScript and Swift through projects I am currently working on.

#### Below are some projects I am working on or have completed.
* Checkers (WIP) [JavaScript] - Checkers game that will eventually support the user playing against an AI opponent.
* Personal Website (WIP) [HTML/CSS/JavaScript] - Will eventually display personal projects and my resume in a digital portfolio format.
* Image Editor [Java] - Simple image editor allowing user to apply various filters and effects to images. (code available on request)
* Freecell Solitaire [Java] - Text-based freecell solitaire game. (code available on request)
* Maze Solver [Java] - Generates a random maze that a user can attempt to solve. Also shows the correct path in either a depth-first or breadth-first search, animating the search process. (code available on request)
